## About the project

### Introduction

*This project is the final project of ESILV course Web Datamining And Semantics* 
<br>
For this project, we have chosen had to study a compilation of 3 different datasets from 3 API about weather, Air Quality and Location in order to realise an Weather Quality application for French cities. We have chosen to realise this project in Python Language, as we are more familiar with it. 

<br> 
The project contains a preliminary data selection, data cleaning, data exploration and data exportation in .owl and .csv files.
All those can be found in the python file [Go to the study](../main/apiAirQulity.py) and the jupyter notebook [Go to the study](../main/Data_creation_csv.ipynb)

The project also includes the SPARQL queries we invented according to our dataset.

Finally, the project also includes an application displaying the different criterias we want to analyse.  

### Tasks achieved 

The project is organized in 3 main parts: 
<br><br>
•	  Part I - Data selection, data cleaning and data exportation 
<br><br>
•	  Part II - Modeling the Ontology, Populate the ontology 
<br><br>
•	Part III - Querying the ontology
<br><br>
•  Part IV - Making the application
